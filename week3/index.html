  <h1>My Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    Hi, I'm Nekeisha Ashlyn Elfa, but you can call me <strong>Keisha</strong> for short ‚ù§Ô∏è
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently studying at Asia Pacific College pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with specialization in Mobile and Internet Technology.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love watching documentary series and sleeping; it is actually my way to unwind üòÑ 
  </p>

  <p>
    In terms of goals in life, I want to continuously learn and grow as an individual, aiming to apply my knowledge and practical skills to make a positive impact in my future profession, while enjoying the journey and creating lasting memories during my college life.
